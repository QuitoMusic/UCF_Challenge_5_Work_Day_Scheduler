# UCF_Challenge_5_Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

A simple task of saving information in a calendar can become tedious when codification knowledge is not vastly understood in the moment. This exercise brings forward the exanding universe of languages that create visual representations of our needs in a complex and, oximoronically simple yet, elegant manner. 

Third-party API's create an extension of the language we already have brought forward in a more concise and derivative way of achieving our goals. By combining all 3 platforms (HTML, CSS and, Javascript) we become more accustomed to the symbols utilized reiterating exercises that create understanding in the long run for us student to become teachers at one point.

This week's assignment provided the tools to connect each real-time application from a front-end perspective analyzing the simplicity of what came after the code was complete. since this week we had a minimal code provided, this brought a lot of attention into what was already in our hands so we could put all the dots together.
